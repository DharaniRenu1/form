                        All law degrees are not created equally. In fact, depending on where you choose to study, there are many different types of law degrees available. While trying to distinguish between them may initially make your eyes cross, here’s a quick breakdown to help you sort through the options.
    
                        The majority of countries offer a Bachelor of Laws (LLB), after which grads take a qualifying examination in order to become practicing lawyers. This degree -- which takes 3-4 years -- is often considered interchangeable with both the BA in Law (BL) and the BSc in Law, although these sometimes involve a broader, more humanities-oriented course of study.
                        
                        The U.S., Japan, Canada, Australia and Hong Kong all offer the Juris Doctor (JD) degree. This three-year professional course of study follows the completion of a separate bachelor’s degree -- which may or may not be in a different discipline. The typical JD takes three years to complete, after which students are eligible to practice law pending the passing of the bar exam.
                        
                        Following the JD, student can opt to pursue a Masters of Laws (LLM). This year-long course of study is a popular choice for international students, and offers the opportunity to specialize in one particular area of practice.
                        
                        While the majority of law degrees prepare candidates for professional careers in the legal sector, students can also take an academic tract with degrees including the Ph.D. in Law, Doctor of Juridical Science (JSD) and Doctor of Laws. The MBA in Law, meanwhile, offers an advanced business degree with a specialization in law.
